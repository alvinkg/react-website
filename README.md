# On useParams

This is to demo useParams.  however it is hard when you have only ONE page to show.

I need to add a few articles I ref here.

The first article I used to build this SPA successfully is below.
[Create A Multi-Page Website With React In 5 Minutes â€“ React Router V6](https://www.techomoro.com/how-to-create-a-multi-page-website-with-react-in-5-minutes/)

It worked flawlessly, however I could not add another blog article which seems to defeat the purpose of the lesson.

So I referred to the article below.

[How to use React Router v6 in React apps](https://blog.logrocket.com/react-router-v6-guide/)

The info overlaps a lot, and I added a 404 view.

To implement the NoMatch functionality, I had to move the component outside the blog page route.

I still got stuck as the working example imported data from an object array, while the example was a POST.jsx function that returned output.
